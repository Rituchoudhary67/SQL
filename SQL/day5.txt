The AVG() function returns the average value of a numeric column. 

# AVG() Syntax
SELECT AVG(column_name)

WHERE condition;


The SUM() function returns the total sum of a numeric column. 

# SUM() Syntax

##### SQL LIKE Operator #####

The LIKE operator is used in a WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column.

There are two wildcards often used in conjunction with the LIKE operator:

 The percent sign (%) represents zero, one, or multiple characters
 The underscore sign (_) represents one, single character


# LIKE Syntax
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE columnN LIKE pattern; 

####### SQL IN Operator #########

The IN operator allows you to specify multiple values in a WHERE clause.

The IN operator is a shorthand for multiple OR conditions.

# IN Syntax
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IN (value1, value2, ...);

or:

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IN (SELECT STATEMENT);
