# SQL LEFT JOIN Keyword
The LEFT JOIN keyword returns all records from the left table (table1), and the matching records 
from the right table (table2). The result is 0 records from the right side, if there is no match.

# LEFT JOIN Syntax
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;

Q. select cust_name from customers and product_id from Product
Ans :  SELECT customers.cust_name, Product.product_id
       FROM Customers
       LEFT JOIN Products ON customers.cust_name = Product.product_id 
       Product BY customers.cust_name ;

output : cust_name       product_id
         Ritu            01
         Raive           02

### SQL RIGHT JOIN Keyword
The RIGHT JOIN keyword returns all records from the right table (table2), and the matching records from .
the left table (table1). The result is 0 records from the left side, if there is no match.

RIGHT JOIN Syntax
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
RIGHT JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
          

### SQL FULL OUTER JOIN Keyword
The FULL OUTER JOIN keyword returns all records when there is a match in left (table1) or right (table2) table records.

Tip: FULL OUTER JOIN and FULL JOIN are the same.

# FULL OUTER JOIN Syntax
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
FULL OUTER JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name
WHERE condition;


### SQL Self Join
A self join is a regular join, but the table is joined with itself.

# Self Join Syntax
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1 T1, table1 T2
WHERE condition;

T1 and T2 are different table aliases for the same table.



######### The SQL UNION Operator #########
The UNION operator is used to combine the result-set of two or more SELECT statements.

1. Every SELECT statement within UNION must have the same number of columns
2. The columns must also have similar data types
3. The columns in every SELECT statement must also be in the same order

# UNION Syntax
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1
UNION
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table2;

UNION ALL Syntax
The UNION operator selects only distinct values by default. To allow duplicate values, use UNION ALL:

# syntax
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1
UNION ALL
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table2;
