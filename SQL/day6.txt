# SQL BETWEEN Operator 
The BETWEEN operator selects values within a given range. The values can be numbers, text, or dates.

The BETWEEN operator is inclusive: begin and end values are included. 

# BETWEEN Syntax
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name BETWEEN value1 AND value2;

demo table : Products

product_id     Product_name      quantity      price       total
01             Saree             20            200         2000
02             T-Shirt           10            100         1000
03             Kurti             5             200         1000
04             lagi              5             120         600

Q. selects all products with a price between 100 and 150:

Ans : SELECT * FROM Products
      WHERE Price BETWEEN 100 AND 150;

output   product_id     Product_name      quantity      price       total
         02             T-Shirt           10            100         1000
         04             lagi              5             120         600


# NOT BETWEEN Example
To display the products outside the range of the previous example, use NOT BETWEEN:

Q. selects all products which price is not between 100 and 150:

Ans : SELECT * FROM products
      WHERE Price NOT BETWEEN 100 AND 150;

output:    product_id     Product_name      quantity      price       total
           01             Saree             20            200         2000
           03             Kurti             5             200         1000
     
# BETWEEN with IN Example

Example:  SELECT * FROM Products
          WHERE Price BETWEEN 100 AND 150
          AND product_id NOT IN (1,2,3);

output :  product_id     Product_name      quantity      price       total
          04             lagi              5             120         600



### SQL Aliases ###

SQL aliases are used to give a table, or a column in a table, a temporary name.

Aliases are often used to make column names more readable.

An alias only exists for the duration of that query.

An alias is created with the AS keyword.


# Alias Column Syntax
  SELECT column_name AS alias_name
  FROM table_name;

# Alias Table Syntax
  SELECT column_name(s)
  FROM table_name AS alias_name;

#### SQL JOIN #####

A JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.

demo table : Product

product_id     Product_name      quantity      price       total
01             Saree             20            200         2000
02             T-Shirt           10            100         1000
03             Kurti             5             200         1000
04             lagi              5             120         600

demo table :- Customers

cust_id         cust_name         cust_city       cust_state        country
01              Ritu              Nagpur          Maharashtra       India
02              Raive             Bokaro          Jharkhand         India
03              Kishore           Bangolore       Karnataka         India
04              Taher             Indore          MP                India


Example:
SELECT Product.product_id, customers.cust_name, Product.total
FROM Product
INNER JOIN Customers ON Product.cust_id=Customers.CustomerID;

output : product_id       cust_name      total
         01               Ritu           2000 
         02               Raive          1000
         03               Kishore        1000
         04               Taher          600

## Different Types of SQL JOINs
Here are the different types of the JOINs in SQL:

(INNER) JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables

LEFT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table

RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table

FULL (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table

### SQL INNER JOIN Keyword

The INNER JOIN keyword selects records that have matching values in both tables.

# INNER JOIN Syntax
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
