# NOT BETWEEN Example
To display the products outside the range of the previous example, use NOT BETWEEN:

Q. selects all products which price is not between 100 and 150:

Ans : SELECT * FROM products
      WHERE Price NOT BETWEEN 100 AND 150;

output:    product_id     Product_name      quantity      price       total
           01             Saree             20            200         2000
           03             Kurti             5             200         1000
     
# BETWEEN with IN Example

Example:  SELECT * FROM Products
          WHERE Price BETWEEN 100 AND 150
          AND product_id NOT IN (1,2,3);

output :  product_id     Product_name      quantity      price       total
          04             lagi              5             120         600
