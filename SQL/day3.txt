#SQL AND, OR and NOT Operators

The WHERE clause can be combined with AND, OR, and NOT operators.

The AND and OR operators are used to filter records based on more than one condition:

    The AND operator displays a record if all the conditions separated by AND are TRUE.
    The OR operator displays a record if any of the conditions separated by OR is TRUE.
    The NOT operator displays a record if the condition(s) is NOT TRUE.

# AND Syntax
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition1 AND condition2 AND condition3 ...;

# OR Syntax
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition1 OR condition2 OR condition3 ...;

# NOT Syntax
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE NOT condition;
